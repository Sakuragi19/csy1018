                Bisesh likes to play basketball alot.
                You can always find him in the local court around 3pm.
                At other times he will be locking himsel in his room, coding or studying.<br>
                Sometimes you can find him buried within his deep thoughts or
                looking up at the stars with his telescope and wondering if there are any other life forms out there.
